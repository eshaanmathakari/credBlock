AI-Powered DeFi Risk Assessment Tool
Problem
In decentralized finance (DeFi), lending platforms on Sei face a significant challenge: assessing the risk of lending to pseudonymous borrowers. Unlike traditional finance, where credit scores and detailed financial histories help evaluate trustworthiness, DeFi relies on blockchain addresses with limited identifiable information. This makes it hard for lenders to gauge the likelihood of repayment, increasing the risk of defaults and reducing confidence in lending protocols.
Solution
Develop an AI-powered risk assessment tool that analyzes on-chain data to generate dynamic risk scores for potential borrowers in Sei’s DeFi lending ecosystem. The AI would examine factors such as:
Transaction history: Frequency, volume, and patterns of activity.

Wallet balances: Total assets, liquidity, and diversity of holdings.

Protocol interactions: Engagement with other DeFi platforms (e.g., borrowing, lending, staking).

Repayment behavior: Historical data on loan repayments (where available).

Using machine learning, the tool would process this data in real-time and assign a risk score to each borrower. Lenders could use these scores to make informed decisions about loan approvals, interest rates, or collateral requirements. The AI could also flag high-risk behaviors, like rapid asset withdrawals or interactions with suspicious contracts.
Benefits
For Lenders: Data-driven insights reduce the chance of defaults and improve lending decisions.

For Borrowers: A fair evaluation based on on-chain activity could unlock better loan terms for users with strong DeFi track records.

For Sei: Boosts trust and adoption of DeFi lending by addressing a critical pain point, leveraging Sei’s fast transaction speeds to process large datasets efficiently.
